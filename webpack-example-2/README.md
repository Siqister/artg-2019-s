# Module / Dispatch example

This example comprehensively illustrates the modular approach to developing your visualization project, and specifically illustrates the use of `d3.dispatch` to communicate between modules.

It also illustrates the use of force simulation, and how force simulation can be modified on the fly.

## Instructions for pulling this code base to local repo (optional)

You don't have to do this if you don't want to look at this code locally. However, if you are interested in pulling this code to your local repo, you can follow these instructions.

1. Navigate to your `artg-2019-s` directory
2. `git checkout -b complete <name of siqi's remote>/complete` will create a new local branch called `complete` that mirrors this remote branch.
